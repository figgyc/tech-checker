            Basically this website lets you write a "check" (some boolean expression) in JavaScript and then type a string and see if it passes the check or not. <br>

            This website is designed for "Ten Words of Wisdom" internet word games, where you have to write
            a written response to some prompt. Often a "technical" restriction is placed on the response,
            for example not being allowed to use certain words. Or something way more complicated than that. But you can use it for whatever.
        </p>
        </p>
            <strong>How to write a tech check:</strong>
            Type JavaScript in the top box, use the variable r to get the content of the response box. The bottom box is to write notes like a prompt.
            If it returns false the response box turns red, if true it stays black. Also there's a word count.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Tip:</strong>
            You can share links with a predefined tech. Change w=11 or c=0 for a custom word and/or character count, 0 is off.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Example (EWOW 10):</strong>
            "You CANNOT use the letters I, L, and O in either uppercase or lowercase, 
            and you CANNOT use the numbers 0 and 1."
        </p>
        <pre><code>!(/[ilo01]/i).test(r)</code></pre>
        <p>Yes this website evals JavaScript from a textbox. Yes that is kinda stupid. If it's any consolation it is <a href="https://github.com/figgyc/tech-checker">open source</a>.</p>
